Comments on making new firmware for Match2

Install NuWriter command tool
https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NUC980_NuWriter_CMD
following instructions asume NuWriter is in a directory next to this project

In the nuwriter directory are pre-build images, that can be used to flash to the board.  
When the cli version of nuwriter is used, you can use ``` sudo ../NUC980_NuWriter_CMD/nuwriter nuwriter/flash.ini ```
uImage contains a webserver lighttpd and php, it uses dhcp to get an network adress
maasland_app.yaffs2 contains the web application to control Match2

To customize the firmware, changes can be made by rebuilding buildroot   
In the overlay directory are configuration files in /etc/   
Some custom scripts go to /scripts/  
maasland_app contains the web application, and is a subtree of https://github.com/pjeutr/MatchApp.git

1) run 'make match_defconfig'
2) run 'make menuconfig' to adjust software
3) run 'make'

After buildroot has been build, the new images can be writen with
``` sudo ../NUC980_NuWriter_CMD/nuwriter nuwriter/fresh.ini ```




-------
Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make nuvoton_nuc972_defconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

If users need to modiy buildroot parameters, user can run 'make menuconfig'
to modify buildroot parameters.

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

If users need to install nuc970_bsp , user need to be root to run 
'./install_bsp.sh' to install nuc970_bsp.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on Freenode IRC.
